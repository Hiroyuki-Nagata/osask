# About 20GO

* These sources are from go_00202/go_0020o, which is created from mingw gcc-3.2
* So, originally these code could be compiled with gcc-3.2 and might be self-bootstrapped
* To maintain the code, fixed many parts of code
* Currently these code could be compiled with gcc-4.7 or higher, or clang++ (maybe...)

# Detailed information

* Files
